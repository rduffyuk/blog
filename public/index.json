This marks the actual start of the Obsidian vault - the physical implementation of the design created on September 11.\nThree days after the planning session with Claude, I created the actual Obsidian vault.\nSeptember 11: The idea and design (with Claude) September 14: The implementation begins\nWhat happened September 12-13?\nHonestly? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. The vault didn\u0026rsquo;t exist yet, so no files were created. Likely:\nWork at BT (day job reality) Mental processing of the design Maybe local development without documentation Life happening between idea and execution The gap between planning and implementation is real. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t a sprint from idea to code - it was three days of normal life with a full-time job before I had time to start building.\n📦 September 14, Afternoon - LibreChat Deployment Vault Evidence: archived-20250916-1559_2025-09-14_convocanvas-backend-testing-infrastructure.md and BLOG-SERIES-SEASON-1-COMPLETE-MAPPING-2025-10-05.md confirm September 14 LibreChat work.\nWhile setting up the vault, I realized ConvoCanvas would need a testing environment. I deployed LibreChat - a self-hosted ChatGPT alternative.\n# LibreChat Docker setup git clone https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat.git cd LibreChat docker-compose up -d # Services running: # LibreChat UI: http://localhost:3080 # MongoDB: localhost:27017 (persistence) # LM Studio integration: Local models Why LibreChat?\nSelf-hosted (privacy-first) Multiple AI provider support (Claude, ChatGPT, local models) Conversation export functionality Testing ground for ConvoCanvas parsing By evening, LibreChat was running. I had a conversation testing environment.\n💻 September 15 - The MVP Build Vault Evidence: archived-20250916-1559_2025-09-15_convocanvas.md documents September 15 ConvoCanvas work including FastAPI backend development and CI/CD pipeline setup.\nSunday morning.

Every architectural decision, every error handling pattern, every parser edge case - discussed with Claude, implemented together.\nVault-First Development: Creating the vault on September 14 gave the project a home. Files had a place to live.\nProper Architecture: Parser → Analyzer → Generator separation meant each component could be tested and improved independently.\nType Safety: Pydantic models caught errors at development time, not runtime.\nWhat Didn\u0026rsquo;t Work Testing Coverage: We built the MVP without comprehensive tests. It worked, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t know why it would keep working.\nEdge Cases: The parser handled standard Save My Chatbot format perfectly. Non-standard formats? Crashes.\nPerformance: No thought given to large conversations (1000+ messages). Would it scale?\nThe Numbers (September 14-15, 2025) Metric Value Development Days 2 (Sept 14-15) Vault Creation Sept 14, 21:33 Services Deployed 2 (LibreChat, FastAPI) Code Lines Written ~300 (parser + analyzer + routes) Test Conversations Processed 3 Content Ideas Generated 18 (from 3 conversations) First Successful Parse Sept 15, evening ★ Insight ───────────────────────────────────── The Value of Collaborative Development:\nBuilding ConvoCanvas wasn\u0026rsquo;t solo work. It was collaboration:\nClaude Code provided architectural patterns and best practices I provided domain knowledge (conversation formats, content types) Together we created something neither would have built alone The 3-day gap from planning (Sept 11) to implementation (Sept 14) is honest reality:\nFull-time job at BT Life between idea and execution Processing time before building Not every day is a development day. That\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nReal projects happen around real life. The honest timeline shows the messy reality of personal projects built while working full-time. ─────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhat I Learned 1. Gaps between planning and implementation are normal September 11: Planning session September 12-13: Life happened, day job continued September 14: Implementation started\n2. Vault creation is the real \u0026ldquo;Day One\u0026rdquo; September 14, 21:33 - First file created. That\u0026rsquo;s when the project physically existed.\n3. MVP means \u0026ldquo;works once successfully\u0026rdquo; 18 content ideas from 3 conversations = proof of concept. Not production-ready, but concept proven.\n4. Collaboration \u0026gt; Solo coding Working with Claude Code meant better architecture, cleaner code, and faster development than I\u0026rsquo;d achieve alone.\n5. Test environments matter LibreChat gave us a real conversation source to test against. Real data beats synthetic tests.\nBuilt on Open Source This MVP wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist without:\nFastAPI - Modern, fast web framework that made async Python actually enjoyable.\nPydantic - Data validation using Python type hints that caught errors before runtime.\nLibreChat - Self-hosted AI chat interface that provided our testing environment.\nSave My Chatbot - Browser extension that made conversation export possible.\nMassive thanks to all maintainers. Your work enables projects like ConvoCanvas.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next September 15 ended with a working MVP. Upload conversation → Get content ideas.\nBut one problem remained unsolved: The original context window overflow error that started this whole journey.\nConvoCanvas could organize past conversations. But hitting context limits on new conversations? Still happening.\nThe solution would require local AI. Unlimited control. No external limits.\nBy September 18-19, I\u0026rsquo;d be installing Ollama and 17 local models. The context window problem was about to meet its match.\nNext Episode: \u0026ldquo;The AI Awakening: Breaking Free from Context Limits\u0026rdquo; - Installing Ollama, deploying DeepSeek R1, and discovering what local AI really means.\nThis is Episode 2 of \u0026ldquo;Season 1: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure\u0026rdquo; - documenting the weekend that turned vault design into working code.\nPrevious Episode: Day Zero: The ConvoCanvas Vision Complete Series: Season 1 Mapping Report\n","permalink":"https://blog.rduffy.uk/posts/season-1-episode-2-mvp/","summary":"From vault design to working code.

Working with Claude, we started planning ChromaDB integration.\nSeptember 21-22: Weekend Implementation Saturday Evening: The Decision Vault Evidence: ChromaDB-Baseline-Performance-Report-2025-09-22.md created 18:45 - Shows 504 documents already indexed, 5-6ms query performance.\nSaturday evening (Sept 21), I set up ChromaDB in a virtual environment:\n# Create environment python -m venv chromadb-env source chromadb-env/bin/activate # Install dependencies pip install chromadb sentence-transformers # Verify GPU access python -c \u0026amp;#34;import torch; print(f\u0026amp;#39;CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}\u0026amp;#39;)\u0026amp;#34; # Output: CUDA: True (RTX 4080 detected) The Indexing Script (vault_indexer.py):\nimport chromadb from sentence-transformers import SentenceTransformer from pathlib import Path # Initialize ChromaDB client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path=\u0026amp;#34;./chromadb_data\u0026amp;#34;) collection = client.get_or_create_collection(\u0026amp;#34;obsidian_vault\u0026amp;#34;) # Load embedding model model = SentenceTransformer(\u0026amp;#39;all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u0026amp;#39;) # 384-dim embeddings def index_file(file_path: Path): \u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#34;Index a single markdown file.\u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#34; with open(file_path, \u0026amp;#39;r\u0026amp;#39;) as f: content = f.read() # Skip empty files if len(content.strip()) \u0026amp;lt; 50: return # Generate embedding embedding = model.encode(content) # Add to collection collection.add( documents=[content], embeddings=[embedding.tolist()], ids=[str(file_path)] ) # Index all markdown files vault_path = Path(\u0026amp;#34;obsidian-vault\u0026amp;#34;) for md_file in vault_path.rglob(\u0026amp;#34;*.md\u0026amp;#34;): index_file(md_file) print(f\u0026amp;#34;Indexed: {md_file}\u0026amp;#34;) print(f\u0026amp;#34;Total files indexed: {collection.count()}\u0026amp;#34;) By Saturday night, I had 504 documents indexed with 5-6ms query performance.\nSunday: Performance Optimization Vault Evidence: ChromaDB-Rust-Backend-Success-2025-09-22.md created 20:20 - Shows 4.7x performance improvement after Rust backend deployment.\nSunday evening (Sept 22), working with Claude, we upgraded to the Rust HNSW backend:\npip install chroma-hnswlib Performance improvement:\nBefore: 33.59ms average query latency After: 7.19ms average query latency 4.7x faster with the Rust backend ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ ChromaDB Architecture - Sept 22, 2025 │ └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ 📁 Vault Files (1,142 markdown files) │ ▼ 🔄 Indexing Pipeline │ ├─→ 📝 Text extraction ├─→ 🧩 Chunking (semantic units) ├─→ 🔢 Embedding generation (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) │ ▼ 💾 ChromaDB Vector Database (Rust HNSW backend) │ ├─→ 📊 504 documents indexed ├─→ 🎯 384-dimensional vectors ├─→ ⚡ 7.19ms average query │ ▼ 🔍 Semantic Search API (Port 8002) │ ├─→ 🤖 Claude (via MCP) ├─→ 💻 Aider (via bridge) └─→ 🌐 Web queries September 23: Work Prep Vault Evidence: ChromaDB-vs-pgvector-Analysis-2025-09-23.md and related files show comparison work for SecureLocal-LLM project.\nMonday (Sept 23) was back to the day job. But I had a Research Team demo scheduled for Tuesday (Sept 24), and I wanted to show this ChromaDB system.\nDuring work, I also compared ChromaDB vs pgvector for a SecureLocal-LLM project. The comparison helped me understand ChromaDB\u0026rsquo;s strengths better:\nSimpler setup than pgvector GPU-accelerated embeddings Better performance for single-user scenarios By Monday evening, the system was demo-ready.\nSeptember 24: The Demo Day Vault Evidence: Research-Team-Demo-Claude-Code-2025-09-24.md shows demo presentation with 598 documents indexed, sub-8ms queries.\nTuesday (Sept 24) - Demo day at work.\nWhat I showed the BT Research Team:\nSystem: ChromaDB \u0026#43; Claude Code \u0026#43; LibreChat Documents Indexed: 598 (grew from 504 over the weekend) Performance: Sub-8ms queries with Redis caching GPU: RTX 4080 (16GB VRAM) Models: 19 specialized AI models via LibreChat Live Demo:\n# Search: \u0026amp;#34;FastAPI refactoring session\u0026amp;#34; # Result: \u0026amp;lt;8ms, found correct file from Sept 15 The demo went well. The team was impressed that I\u0026rsquo;d built this over a weekend.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the reality: I wasn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;presenting my personal project\u0026rdquo; - I was demoing a tool that would help with our enterprise AI work. The line between personal exploration and work preparation was blurry.\nSeptember 27: The Scaling Push Vault Evidence: 1-High-ChromaDB-Indexing-Success-Report-2025-09-27.md shows massive indexing improvement to 24,916 documents, 98.6% vault coverage.\nBy Friday (Sept 27), I\u0026rsquo;d spent more time optimizing. Working with Claude, we achieved a massive scaling improvement:\nBefore (Sept 22):\nDocuments: 504 Coverage: 65% of vault Chunks per file: ~1 After (Sept 27):\nDocuments: 24,916 Coverage: 98.6% of vault Chunks per file: ~32 Performance: Maintained \u0026lt;10ms queries The breakthrough: Proper chunking. Instead of indexing whole files, we broke them into 750-token semantic chunks. This meant:\n32x more precise search results Better context matching Maintained fast query speed 4,840% improvement in one week.\nThe First Real Search With 24,916 documents indexed, I could finally ask natural language questions:\nSearch Interface:\ndef search_vault(query: str, n_results: int = 5): \u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#34;Search vault with semantic similarity.\u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#34; # Generate query embedding query_embedding = model.encode(query) # Search collection results = collection.query( query_embeddings=[query_embedding.tolist()], n_results=n_results ) return results Example Query:\nsearch_vault(\u0026amp;#34;How did I set up Ollama with DeepSeek?\u0026amp;#34;) Result (in 0.4 seconds):\n{ \u0026amp;#34;results\u0026amp;#34;: [ { \u0026amp;#34;file\u0026amp;#34;: \u0026amp;#34;2025-09-18-LLM-Inference-Servers-Comparison.md\u0026amp;#34;, \u0026amp;#34;similarity\u0026amp;#34;: \u0026amp;#34;94.2%\u0026amp;#34;, \u0026amp;#34;preview\u0026amp;#34;: \u0026amp;#34;DeepSeek R1:7b achieves 71.61 tokens/sec...\u0026amp;#34; }, { \u0026amp;#34;file\u0026amp;#34;: \u0026amp;#34;2025-09-18-reflection-journal.md\u0026amp;#34;, \u0026amp;#34;similarity\u0026amp;#34;: \u0026amp;#34;91.7%\u0026amp;#34;, \u0026amp;#34;preview\u0026amp;#34;: \u0026amp;#34;Configured Ollama with GPU optimization...\u0026amp;#34; } ] } It worked. No more 25-minute manual searches. Semantic search found exactly what I needed in under half a second.\nWhat Worked Rust HNSW Backend: 4.7x performance improvement with zero code changes. Just pip install chroma-hnswlib.\nSemantic Chunking: Breaking files into 750-token chunks instead of whole-file indexing gave 32x better precision.\nGPU Acceleration: RTX 4080 generated embeddings 10x faster than CPU. Weekend project became viable because of GPU speed.\nMCP Integration: Claude Code could now search the vault via MCP. The AI building its own memory system.\nWhat Still Sucked Work/Personal Boundary: Built this for personal use, but demoed at work. Is it a personal project or work tool? Both? Neither?\nObsession Creep: Spent Friday evening (Sept 27) optimizing something that already worked. The 504→24,916 scaling was cool but\u0026hellip; did I need it?\nNo Web Interface: CLI-only search. Fine for me, but not shareable.\nThe Numbers (Sept 20-27, 2025) Metric Value Files in Vault 1,142 Documents Indexed 24,916 (chunked) Initial Indexing Sept 21-22 (weekend) Performance Optimization Sept 22 (Rust backend) Work Demo Sept 24 (BT Research Team) Scaling Work Sept 27 (chunking optimization) Search Speed \u0026lt;10ms average GPU Utilization RTX 4080 (10x faster than CPU) ★ Insight ───────────────────────────────────── The Blurry Line Between Work and Personal Projects:\nThis episode reveals something I didn\u0026rsquo;t plan to write about: the boundary between personal exploration and work preparation is fuzzy.\nWeekend work: Built ChromaDB for personal vault (Sept 21-22) Monday prep: Compared ChromaDB vs pgvector for work project (Sept 23) Tuesday demo: Showed personal tool at work meeting (Sept 24) Friday optimization: Scaled system for\u0026hellip; both? (Sept 27) Was this a personal project I happened to demo at work? Or work research I happened to do at home?\nBoth. And that\u0026rsquo;s okay. The best personal projects often inform professional work. The best professional learning often happens in personal time.\nBuilding while working a full-time job means these lines blur. Rather than pretending they\u0026rsquo;re separate, this episode acknowledges the reality: innovation happens in the overlap. ─────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhat I Learned 1. Weekend implementation + Monday demo = Real pressure The BT demo deadline (Sept 24) made the weekend work (Sept 21-22) more focused. Deadlines work.\n2. Semantic search isn\u0026rsquo;t optional above 100 files Traditional file search broke down after ~100 files. Semantic search scaled to 1,000+ effortlessly.\n3. GPU acceleration matters for experimentation speed 10x faster embeddings meant weekend project became viable. Without RTX 4080, this would\u0026rsquo;ve taken weeks.\n4. Work context influences personal projects The pgvector comparison (Sept 23) was for work, but it made my personal ChromaDB system better. Cross-pollination is valuable.\n5. 4,840% improvement sounds impressive but\u0026hellip; Going from 504 to 24,916 documents was cool, but did I need it? Sometimes optimization is just fun, not necessary.\nBuilt on Open Source This episode wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist without incredible open source projects:\nChromaDB - The AI-native embedding database that made semantic search possible. Fast, simple, and GPU-accelerated.\nsentence-transformers - Provided the embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, later mxbai-embed) that turned markdown into searchable vectors.\nPrefect - Modern workflow orchestration that would later automate the daily indexing pipeline.\nObsidian - The local-first knowledge management tool where this entire journey lives.\nMassive thanks to these communities for building tools that let individuals create infrastructure that would have required teams just years ago.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next ChromaDB was working. The vault was searchable. But a bigger question loomed:\nWhere should all this infrastructure run?\nDocker Compose? Kubernetes? Something else?\nBy September 30, I\u0026rsquo;d be researching K3s - lightweight Kubernetes for edge computing. By early October, I\u0026rsquo;d make an infrastructure decision. And by October 5, that decision would crash spectacularly.\nBut first, the research phase.\nNext Episode: \u0026ldquo;The Infrastructure Debate: K3s vs Docker Compose\u0026rdquo; - Weekend warrior meets enterprise infrastructure, and discovers K3s.\nThis is Episode 4 of \u0026ldquo;Season 1: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure\u0026rdquo; - documenting the weekend that transformed 1,142 files from chaos into searchable knowledge, and the blurry line between personal projects and work demos.\nPrevious Episode: The AI Awakening: Ollama + DeepSeek Integration Complete Series: Season 1 Mapping Report\n","permalink":"https://blog.rduffy.uk/posts/season-1-episode-4-documentation-overload/","summary":"A weekend implementing ChromaDB, a Monday demoing it at work, and discovering that 1,142 files need more than folders - they need semantic search.","title":"ChromaDB Weekend: From 504 to 24,916 Documents"},{"content":"Episode 1: Day Zero - The ConvoCanvas Vision Series: Season 1 - From Zero to Automated Infrastructure Episode: 1 of 8 Date: September 11, 2025 (Evening) Reading Time: 7 minutes\n💥 The Error That Started Everything ❌ Error: Context window overflow. This conversation is too long to continue. Would you like to start a new chat? I stared at that message. Again.\nI\u0026rsquo;d been debugging a network automation script with Claude Code, making progress, understanding the problem\u0026hellip; and boom - context limit reached. All that conversation history, all those refinements, all that shared understanding\u0026hellip; gone.\nStart a new chat? Sure. Lose all that context? Not acceptable.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t new. My AI conversations folder had 200+ markdown files scattered across ChatGPT exports, Claude transcripts, Gemini sessions, Perplexity research. No structure. No searchability. No way to extract value.\nI was drowning in conversations that should have been knowledge.\n🌙 September 11, 8:06 PM - The Planning Session Vault Evidence: 20-06-20_Claude-ConvoCanvas-Planning-Complete.md created September 11, 2025, documents the complete planning session for ConvoCanvas vault structure, tag taxonomy, and automation foundation.\nThat evening, I opened a conversation with Claude:\n\u0026ldquo;I want to build a system that turns AI conversations into content. Not manually - automatically. Can we design an Obsidian vault structure for this?\u0026rdquo;\nWhat followed was a 90-minute planning session working with Claude Code. Not me alone - collaborating with Claude to design what would become ConvoCanvas.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t solo work. It was the first of many collaborative sessions that would build this entire system.\n🗂️ The Vision: Vault Structure for Value Extraction ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ 🌟 Day Zero Architecture - Sept 11, 2025 │ │ (Designed with Claude Code) │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ 👤 200\u0026#43; AI Conversations Scattered markdown files │ ▼ 💡 The Realization \u0026amp;#34;Context limits are killing value\u0026amp;#34; │ ┌───────────┼───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ 📁 01-AI 💎 02- 📚 03- 🔧 04- 📋 05- Conversations Content- Learning- Project- Templates Raw material Ideas Log Development Extracted Knowledge ConvoCanvas Automation value capture itself foundation │ │ │ │ │ └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘ │ ▼ 🏷️ Tag Taxonomy (50\u0026#43; tags) │ ▼ 🚀 Future: Automated Content Pipeline Working with Claude, we designed a vault structure that wasn\u0026rsquo;t just storage - it was a content creation pipeline waiting to be built:\nConvoCanvas-Vault/ ├── 01-AI-Conversations/ # Raw conversations │ ├── Claude/ # Claude Code sessions │ ├── ChatGPT/ # ChatGPT exports │ ├── Gemini/ # Gemini sessions │ └── Perplexity/ # Research chats ├── 02-Content-Ideas/ # Extracted opportunities │ ├── LinkedIn-Posts/ # Social media ideas │ ├── Blog-Drafts/ # Long-form content │ └── Video-Concepts/ # Tutorial ideas ├── 03-Learning-Log/ # Knowledge capture │ ├── Daily-Notes/ # What I learned │ ├── Technical-Insights/ # How things work │ └── Challenges-Solutions/ # Problems solved ├── 04-Project-Development/ # ConvoCanvas itself │ ├── ConvoCanvas-Design/ # Architecture decisions │ ├── Code-Snippets/ # Reusable code │ └── Architecture-Decisions/ # Why we built it this way └── 05-Templates/ # Automation foundation ├── Conversation-Analysis/ # How to extract insights ├── Content-Planning/ # Content generation └── Learning-Reflection/ # Daily learning capture Simple. Purposeful. Ready to automate.\n🏷️ The Tag Taxonomy: Making Conversations Searchable We didn\u0026rsquo;t stop at folders. Claude and I designed a tagging system to make conversations searchable across multiple dimensions:\nBy AI Service:\n#claude #chatgpt #gemini #perplexity By Content Potential:\n#linkedin-post #blog-idea #video-concept #tutorial-idea #case-study By Technical Domain:\n#network-engineering #automation #ci-cd #kubernetes #open-source By Development Context:\n#convocanvas-dev #python #react #docker #fastapi The power: Search for #claude #kubernetes #tutorial-idea and find conversations that could become Kubernetes tutorials based on Claude sessions.\nEvery conversation becomes discoverable across multiple axes.\n📝 Templates: The Automation Foundation Working with Claude, we created templates that would structure every conversation for maximum value extraction.\nConversation Analysis Template (designed Sept 11):\n# Conversation Analysis: {{title}} ## Metadata - **Date**: {{date}} - **AI Service**: {{service}} - **Duration**: {{duration}} - **Topic Focus**: [auto-extracted] ## Key Insights - [Automatically extracted important points] ## Technical Learning Points - [Code snippets, commands, configurations] ## Content Opportunities ### LinkedIn Posts - [ ] [Generated idea 1] - [ ] [Generated idea 2] ### Blog Ideas - [ ] [Generated topic 1] - [ ] [Generated topic 2] ### Video/Tutorial Concepts - [ ] [Generated concept 1] This template would become the foundation for ConvoCanvas\u0026rsquo;s content extraction engine - but on September 11, it was just a design in a markdown file.\n🎯 The Real Problem We Were Solving As Claude and I talked through the design, the real problem crystallized:\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t about storage - I had 200+ markdown files already.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t about organization - folders are trivial.\nIt was about VALUE EXTRACTION - at scale, automatically.\nEvery AI conversation contains:\n🧠 Technical insights worth documenting 💡 Problem-solving approaches worth sharing 💻 Code snippets worth reusing 📢 Content ideas worth publishing But manually reviewing 200+ conversations to find those gems? Impossible.\nConvoCanvas would need to:\n🔍 Auto-parse conversation formats (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) 🏷️ Auto-tag based on content analysis ✨ Auto-generate content ideas from insights 📊 Auto-structure knowledge for searchability The vision was clear. Now we needed to build it.\n🌃 10:00 PM - Session Complete By 10 PM, the vault structure was designed. Templates were drafted. The tag taxonomy was documented.\nBut nothing was built yet.\nThis was planning. Design. Architecture. Collaboration with Claude to create the blueprint.\nWhat I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that night:\nIn 3 days, I\u0026rsquo;d have a working MVP In 7 days, I\u0026rsquo;d install 17 local AI models In 11 days, I\u0026rsquo;d deploy ChromaDB semantic search In 19 days, I\u0026rsquo;d have 24,916 documents indexed In 25 days, I\u0026rsquo;d be writing this blog series about the journey September 11 was Day Zero. The idea was born. Implementation would start in 3 days.\nWhat Worked Working with Claude: This wasn\u0026rsquo;t solo work. Claude Code and I collaborated on vault design, tag taxonomy, and template structure. AI-assisted architecture from day one.\nVault-First Thinking: Designing the vault structure before writing code meant the implementation would have a clear target.\nAutomation-Ready Design: Every folder, every tag, every template was designed with automation in mind. Not \u0026ldquo;organize manually\u0026rdquo; - \u0026ldquo;automate extraction.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat I Didn\u0026rsquo;t Know Yet The Scale: 200 conversations seemed like a lot. By October 5, I\u0026rsquo;d have 1,142 markdown files and still growing.\nThe Infrastructure: On Sept 11, I thought this would be a simple Python script. By October, it would be K3s clusters, vector databases, and automated workflows.\nThe Meta-Loop: I had no idea ConvoCanvas would eventually analyze its own creation and write this blog series.\nThe Numbers (September 11, 2025) Metric Value Session Duration 90 minutes Files Created 1 (planning document) Code Written 0 lines Folders Designed 5 Tags Defined 50+ Templates Created 3 Conversations Analyzed 0 (just planning) ★ Insight ───────────────────────────────────── The Power of Collaborative Design:\nWorking with Claude Code to design ConvoCanvas wasn\u0026rsquo;t outsourcing - it was multiplying capability.\nI brought the problem: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m drowning in AI conversations with no structure.\u0026rdquo; Claude brought architecture patterns: \u0026ldquo;Vault structure + tag taxonomy + templates.\u0026rdquo; Together we designed a system neither would have created alone.\nThis entire 25-day journey started with one collaborative planning session.\nAI-assisted doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean AI-replaced. It means AI-amplified.\nHuman understanding of the problem + AI understanding of solution patterns = Systems that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist otherwise. ─────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhat I Learned 1. Design before code 90 minutes of planning saved weeks of refactoring. We designed the vault structure once and it stayed consistent through 25 days of development.\n2. Automate from the start Every design decision was \u0026ldquo;how will this automate?\u0026rdquo; not \u0026ldquo;how will I manually maintain this?\u0026rdquo; Templates, tags, folders - all automation-ready.\n3. Collaboration \u0026gt; Solo work Claude and I designed this together. Not me dictating to AI, not AI generating without context. Back-and-forth collaborative design.\n4. The meta-problem is always bigger Started with \u0026ldquo;organize conversations.\u0026rdquo; Realized the real problem was \u0026ldquo;extract value at scale.\u0026rdquo; The vault structure reflected the bigger vision.\n5. Day Zero matters This planning session shaped everything that followed. The vault structure, tag taxonomy, and templates became the foundation for ChromaDB indexing, semantic search, and automated content generation.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next September 11 ended with a plan. No code. No implementation. Just a vision documented in markdown.\nSeptember 12-13 would be silent - no vault activity, no conversations saved. Pure development days building the MVP that would bring this vision to life.\nSeptember 14-15 would change everything - the first working code, the first successful parse, the first content ideas extracted from conversations.\nThe blueprint was ready. Now it was time to build.\nNext Episode: \u0026ldquo;Building the Foundation: MVP in 72 Hours\u0026rdquo; - From vault design to working FastAPI backend.

The documentation captures 25 days accurately. What comes next depends on how AI capabilities evolve and what makes sense to build.\nThe collaboration is documented. The system works for now. The journey continues. ─────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhat I Learned (Meta-Lessons from Collaboration) 1. Documentation is a side effect of good architecture The vault, ChromaDB, MCP integration - these weren\u0026rsquo;t documentation tools. But they enabled perfect historical recall for both human and AI.\n2. Collaboration reveals patterns neither sees alone Searching 200+ conversations with Claude revealed development patterns: weekend work sessions, evening debugging, 12-iteration design processes, work/life balance reality.\n3. The best case study is your own collaborative work ConvoCanvas proving itself by having Claude help document its own creation is more convincing than any demo.\n4. Meta-awareness compounds value through collaboration\nJournal automation → captures work (human + AI) ChromaDB indexing → makes it searchable (AI) Blog generation → makes it shareable (human + AI collaborative writing) Each layer adds value to the previous 5. When human + AI document the system together, you\u0026rsquo;ve succeeded If your AI system can\u0026rsquo;t collaboratively explain its own architecture and history, the partnership isn\u0026rsquo;t effective enough. This series proves the collaboration works.\n6. Honest iteration beats grand promises ConvoCanvas isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;done.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s on pause, being rethought. That\u0026rsquo;s the reality of building in 2025 when AI capabilities change weekly. Honest progress beats false completion.\nSeason 1: Complete Episode 1: Day Zero - The ConvoCanvas Vision Episode 2: Building the Foundation - Vault Creation to MVP Episode 3: The AI Awakening - Breaking Free from Context Limits Episode 4: ChromaDB Weekend Episode 5: The Migration Question Episode 6: When Everything Crashes Episode 7: Teaching the System to Document Itself Episode 8: Teaching the System to Blog About Itself ← You are here\nTotal: 15,550 words documenting 25 days of human + AI collaborative development\nThe Reality: An Idea That Needs Refinement October 6, 5:30 AM. Season 1 documentation is complete. But the truth is more nuanced than \u0026ldquo;system complete.\u0026rdquo;\nI had the idea to automate blog generation and posting - to have ConvoCanvas continuously document itself. The capability is there: vault search works, content analysis works, the system can write.\nBut it needs far more refinement. The automation I envisioned isn\u0026rsquo;t production-ready. It needs:\nBetter prompt engineering for consistent quality Editorial review workflows (human in the loop) Platform-specific formatting (LinkedIn vs Medium vs Dev.to) Scheduling and cadence management Quality gates before auto-posting Tonight I spent time with Claude Code going through my files to try and capture the journey thus far. Not automated blog generation - collaborative documentation. Human context + AI pattern recognition + vault evidence = this blog series.\nConvoCanvas: On Pause and Rethinking ConvoCanvas isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;complete.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s on pause while I rethink everything.\nThe MVP works. The components work. But the speed at which AI developments and innovations happen every week means what I built in September might be obsolete by November.\nThe challenge:\nNew models drop weekly (Gemini 2.0, Claude Opus 4, GPT-5 rumors) Better RAG patterns emerge constantly Local inference capabilities improve monthly Infrastructure patterns evolve rapidly The opportunity: Continue to build the core system. Make further improvements. But stay agile enough to integrate new capabilities as they emerge.\nWhat This Journey Really Proved Working with Claude Code over these 25 days, I realized something important:\nI\u0026rsquo;m a simple engineer who\u0026rsquo;s not great at coding. Before AI assistance, complex architectures like this would have been beyond my skill level. I\u0026rsquo;d have gotten stuck on Kubernetes networking, never figured out ChromaDB integration, struggled with async Python patterns.\nBut AI as a tool - used right - enabled me to transition my self-development to new bounds.\nNot because AI \u0026ldquo;did it for me.\u0026rdquo; Because:\nClaude provided patterns I didn\u0026rsquo;t know existed I provided context and judgment AI couldn\u0026rsquo;t have Together we debugged problems neither could solve alone I learned constantly by seeing how Claude approached problems This is the exciting time ahead for us all. What we can achieve together with AI - when we use it as a collaborator, not a replacement - is genuinely transformative.\nA year ago, this infrastructure would have taken me months and probably failed. With Claude Code as a partner, 25 days produced a working system I actually understand.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the real story of Season 1.\nEpilogue: The Collaboration That Wrote This This blog series was generated through collaborative work between user and Claude Code on October 5-6, 2025:\n11:30 PM - User request: \u0026ldquo;search the vault from this past month and let create blog series\u0026rdquo; 11:35 PM - Vault search (Claude + MCP AI Memory finding evidence) 11:50 PM - Timeline analysis (Claude analyzing 200+ conversations, user providing context) 12:00 AM - 5:30 AM - 8 episodes written collaboratively\nClaude: Pattern recognition, vault searching, evidence gathering User: Context, judgment, validation, honest narrative framing 8 episodes. 15,550 words. 6 hours of collaborative writing.\nNot automated blog generation. Not AI replacing human. Human + AI partnership using tools we built together.\nWhat Season 2 Might Bring (If It Happens) No grand promises. Just honest possibilities:\nFurther refinement of the core system Integration of new AI capabilities as they emerge Continued learning through human + AI collaboration More honest documentation of what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t Building in public, failing in public, learning in public The meta-loop continues - but at human pace, with human judgment, through human + AI collaboration.\nThis is the real future of development: not AI replacing engineers, but AI enabling engineers to build things they couldn\u0026rsquo;t build alone.\nSeason 1 proved that\u0026rsquo;s possible. What comes next? We\u0026rsquo;ll find out together.\nThis is the final episode of \u0026ldquo;Season 1: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure\u0026rdquo; - The story of a human + AI collaboration that learned to document its own existence.\nPrevious Episode: Teaching the System to Document Itself Complete Series: Season 1 Mapping Report\nThe End of Season 1\nNot a conclusion.

Not static images - living documentation that updates itself from the actual cluster state.\nWorking with Claude Code that evening, we built an automated architecture visualization system.\nThe Challenge: Complexity Hidden in kubectl The infrastructure was complex, but it was all queryable:\n# Get all services kubectl get svc -A # Get pod relationships kubectl get pods -A -o json | jq \u0026amp;#39;.items[].spec.containers[].env\u0026amp;#39; # Get network policies kubectl get networkpolicies -A # Get persistent volumes kubectl get pvc -A The data was there. But kubectl output doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain relationships. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t show:\nWhich services talk to which other services How data flows through the system What external dependencies exist Which components are critical path We needed to transform cluster state into visual architecture.\nThe ASCII Diagram Solution ASCII diagrams are text-based and render everywhere:\nConvoCanvas ──→ Ollama │ └─────→ ChromaDB Benefits:\nPure text (version controllable) Renders everywhere (terminal, markdown, Hugo) Can be generated programmatically Zero dependencies or renderers required The Plan: Query K3s → Parse relationships → Generate ASCII diagrams → Auto-commit to git\nBuilding the Generator Working with Claude, we iterated through multiple approaches.\nIteration 1: Pod List First attempt: Just list all pods\nkubectl get pods -A -o json | jq -r \u0026amp;#39;.items[] | \u0026amp;#34;\\(.metadata.namespace)/\\(.metadata.name)\u0026amp;#34;\u0026amp;#39; Result: A flat list with no relationships.

Working with Claude, not replacing myself This wasn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;AI writes diagrams while I watch.\u0026rdquo; It was back-and-forth: I understood the architecture, Claude suggested Mermaid syntax, I validated output, Claude refined approach. Collaboration, not replacement.\n2. One diagram can\u0026rsquo;t show everything Tried building \u0026ldquo;the ultimate architecture diagram\u0026rdquo; showing all layers. Failed. Three specialized ASCII diagrams (high-level, deployment, data-flow) served different needs better.\n3. Automation justifies complexity Writing diagram generator was more work than hand-coding one diagram. But it runs daily forever, compounding value. One-time cost, permanent benefit.\n4. Git history for diagrams = architectural archaeology Looking at diagram diffs shows exactly when services were added, removed, or reconfigured. Better than documentation - it\u0026rsquo;s the actual evolution.\n5. Self-documenting systems are achievable Not science fiction. Query cluster state → Generate markdown → Commit to git. The system describes itself because we taught it how.\nBuilt on Open Source This automation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist without:\nASCII Art Tradition - Text-based diagramming that works everywhere without dependencies. Terminal-native, version-controllable, and renders in any context.\nPrefect - Modern workflow orchestration that made daily automation trivial to deploy and monitor.\njq - JSON processor that made parsing kubectl output possible in bash scripts.\nK3s - Lightweight Kubernetes that made querying cluster state via kubectl both possible and practical.\nThanks to these projects for building tools that enable self-documenting infrastructure.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next October 7 evening ended with automated diagram generation running.\nThe system could now:\nParse conversations (ConvoCanvas) Generate content with local LLMs (Ollama) Search semantically (ChromaDB) Run reliably (K3s, rebuilt from crash) Monitor itself (Prometheus/Grafana) Document itself (automated diagrams) There was one thing left to automate: Writing the blog series documenting its own creation.\nCould the AI that built this infrastructure also write the story of building it?\nBy early October, working with Claude, I\u0026rsquo;d find out.\nNext Episode: \u0026ldquo;Teaching AI to Blog About Itself: The Ultimate Meta-Project\u0026rdquo; - When ConvoCanvas becomes its own case study, and Season 1 writes itself.\nThis is Episode 7 of \u0026ldquo;Season 1: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure\u0026rdquo; - documenting the evening we taught the system to document itself.\nPrevious Episode: When Everything Crashes: The K3s Resurrection Complete Series: Season 1 Mapping Report\n","permalink":"https://blog.rduffy.uk/posts/season-1-episode-7-diagram-automation/","summary":"From hand-coded Mermaid diagrams to automated architecture visualization.

The MVP could parse conversations and generate content ideas. But the original problem that started this whole journey? Still unsolved.\n❌ Error: Context window overflow. This conversation is too long to continue. Auto-compacting conversation... I was still hitting context limits. Still losing conversation history. Still starting over every time Claude Code or ChatGPT hit their limits.\nConvoCanvas could organize the past conversations, but it couldn\u0026rsquo;t prevent me from hitting limits on new conversations.\nThe real problem wasn\u0026rsquo;t storage - it was conversation continuity.\nThe Realization: I Need My Own Models Vault Evidence: Sept 18 reflection journal (319 lines) documents the full day of Ollama research, installation, and setup working with Claude Code. The journal shows activity from 6:30 AM through 11:00 PM - a complete weekend day focused on this work.\nWednesday evening after work at BT, I researched local LLMs. The issue wasn\u0026rsquo;t cost (I was using Claude Code, not paying per API call). The issue was control.\nWhat I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control with external services:\n❌ Context window limits - Hit 200K tokens? Start over. ❌ Conversation persistence - Can\u0026rsquo;t continue yesterday\u0026rsquo;s deep dive ❌ Model availability - Service down? Can\u0026rsquo;t work. ❌ Privacy concerns - Every conversation goes to external servers ❌ Experimentation freedom - Can\u0026rsquo;t test ideas without worrying about limits What I needed:\n✅ Configurable context (choose models with appropriate limits) ✅ Persistent conversations (save and resume anytime) ✅ 24/7 availability (works offline) ✅ Complete privacy (never leaves my machine) ✅ Unlimited experimentation (no external throttling or billing) I needed local inference. I needed Ollama.\nReality check: Local models still have context limits (Llama 3.1: 128K tokens, DeepSeek R1: 32K tokens). But I could choose the right model for each task and save/resume conversations across sessions. The win wasn\u0026rsquo;t unlimited context - it was control over the context.\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ External Services vs Local Control (Sept 18) │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ EXTERNAL (Claude/ChatGPT) LOCAL (Ollama) ───────────────────────────── ────────────────── ❌ Hard context limits → ✅ Configurable limits ❌ Forced restarts → ✅ Save/resume anytime ❌ Service dependency → ✅ Offline capable ❌ External logging → ✅ Complete privacy ❌ Rate limiting → ✅ Unlimited local use TRADE-OFF: Claude reasoning quality \u0026amp;gt; Local model quality BUT: Local persistence \u0026amp;gt; Forced restarts September 19, Morning - Installation (Working with Claude) Vault Evidence: Sept 18 journal shows \u0026ldquo;Ollama + DeepSeek R1 installation\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Model Performance\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Concurrent Loading\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Timeout Tuning\u0026rdquo; - confirming Ollama work happened Sept 18-19.\nSaturday morning. Time to install Ollama.\nWorking with Claude Code throughout the day, I researched hardware requirements, model selection, and performance targets.\nClaude and I worked through:\nHardware compatibility (RTX 4080, 16GB VRAM) Model quantization (GGUF formats) Concurrent model loading strategies Context window comparisons # Install Ollama (Claude provided the command) curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh # Verify GPU access ollama run llama3.1 # Output: Using NVIDIA RTX 4080, 16GB VRAM # Model loaded in 2.3 seconds IT WORKED.\nThe RTX 4080 was humming. VRAM usage: 6.2GB for Llama 3.1 8B. Plenty of headroom.\nMid-Morning - Model Collection Working with Claude to understand which models to install, I started pulling models:\n# Reasoning specialist (Claude\u0026amp;#39;s recommendation) ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b # General purpose (fastest) ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct # Meta\u0026amp;#39;s latest ollama pull llama3.1:8b # Code specialist ollama pull codellama:7b # Uncensored variant (for creative tasks) ollama pull nous-hermes-2:latest # Compact model (2B for quick tasks) ollama pull phi-3:mini Total download: 42GB Installation time: 35 minutes Models available: 6\nBut Claude suggested more models for different use cases. By afternoon, I had 17 models installed.\nVault Evidence: Sept 18 journal confirms \u0026ldquo;DeepSeek R1:7b achieves 71.61 tokens/sec on RTX 4080\u0026rdquo; - showing actual performance testing happened.\nModel Size Purpose VRAM Context Window DeepSeek R1 7B Reasoning \u0026amp; analysis 4.2GB 32K tokens Mistral Instruct 7B General chat 4.1GB 32K tokens Llama 3.1 8B Latest Meta model 4.8GB 128K tokens CodeLlama 7B Code generation 4.3GB 16K tokens Nous Hermes 2 7B Creative writing 4.2GB 8K tokens Phi-3 Mini 2B Quick tasks 1.4GB 4K tokens Qwen 2.5 7B Multilingual 4.5GB 32K tokens Neural Chat 7B Conversational 4.0GB 8K tokens Orca Mini 3B Compact reasoning 1.9GB 2K tokens Vicuna 7B Research assistant 4.4GB 2K tokens WizardCoder 7B Code debugging 4.3GB 16K tokens Zephyr 7B Instruction following 4.1GB 8K tokens OpenHermes 7B General purpose 4.2GB 8K tokens Starling 7B Advanced reasoning 4.6GB 8K tokens Solar 10.7B Performance leader 6.8GB 4K tokens Yi-34B 34B (quantized) Heavy lifting 12.1GB 4K tokens Mixtral 8x7B 47B (quantized) Mixture of experts 14.2GB 32K tokens The RTX 4080 could handle them all.

Unlike Claude Code or ChatGPT, which force conversation compaction when you hit limits, Ollama conversations could theoretically continue as long as VRAM allowed.\nThe Real Win Wasn\u0026rsquo;t Unlimited Context - it was something else entirely.\nEvening - The Control Realization The breakthrough wasn\u0026rsquo;t about having infinite context. It was about owning the conversation.\nWhat Changed:\nBefore: Hit 200K tokens → System forces auto-compact → Lose nuance After: Choose model with appropriate context → Manage memory myself → Decide when to move on The Freedom I Gained:\nExternal Service: \u0026amp;#34;You\u0026amp;#39;ve hit the limit.

The Sept 18 reflection journal shows:\nMorning (6:30 AM): Starting automation systems Afternoon: Ollama installation and model collection Evening (through 11:00 PM): Supervisor pattern, testing, integration But it was also broken up by life:\nWork at BT during the week (Monday-Friday) Saturday-Sunday: Personal project time Breaks between intense coding sessions Real life happening around the development The journal shows the reality: This was focused weekend work, not a corporate \u0026ldquo;sprint\u0026rdquo;. Personal time, personal pace, personal project.\nWhat Worked Working with Claude Code: This supervisor pattern, model selection strategy, VRAM optimization - all designed collaboratively. Claude brought patterns, I brought context, together we built something better.\nOllama\u0026rsquo;s Model Management: Single command to pull, update, or remove models. No Docker containers, no config files, no complexity.\nContext Persistence: Finally solved the original Day Zero problem - no more losing conversation history!\nGPU Performance: RTX 4080 handled everything I threw at it. 16GB VRAM was the sweet spot for running multiple 7B models.\nPrivacy \u0026amp; Control: All conversations stay local. No external logging. Complete ownership of my AI interactions.\nWhat Still Sucked Model Switching Latency: Loading a new model: 2-4 seconds. Not terrible, but noticeable when switching frequently.\nVRAM Juggling: Can\u0026rsquo;t run Mixtral 8x7B (14.2GB) alongside anything else. Had to be strategic about which models stayed loaded.\nQuality Variance: Some models (Phi-3 Mini) were fast but shallow. Others (DeepSeek R1) were brilliant but slower. Required testing to find the right fit.\nStill Need Claude Code: Local models are good, but Claude Code\u0026rsquo;s reasoning is still unmatched for complex tasks. Ollama complements, doesn\u0026rsquo;t replace.\nThe Numbers (Sept 18-19, 2025) Metric Value Time Spent Weekend (Saturday-Sunday) Work Hours ~15 hours (split across 2 days) Models Installed 17 Total Download Size 78GB VRAM Available 16GB (RTX 4080) Context Limit Freedom Unlimited (hardware-bound) Average Response Time 2.1 seconds Concurrent Models 3 (12.4GB VRAM) External Dependencies Eliminated ★ Insight ───────────────────────────────────── The Freedom of Local Inference:\nSwitching to local LLMs wasn\u0026rsquo;t about cost - it was about solving the original problem:\nOwnership - You control when conversations end, not a service Privacy - Conversations never leave the machine Offline capability - No internet required Experimentation freedom - Iterate without external throttling Learning - Direct access to model internals, VRAM, performance tuning Choice - Pick models with context windows matching your needs This was built working WITH Claude Code - collaborative AI development where human understanding + AI patterns created better solutions than either alone.\nThe cost savings ($0/year vs potential API costs) were a bonus. The real win was control over the context window.\nDay Zero\u0026rsquo;s context window problem? Not eliminated - but now under MY control. ─────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhat I Learned 1. Weekend projects fit around full-time work Saturday-Sunday intensive work. Monday-Friday back to day job. This is the reality of personal projects.\n2. Collaboration makes better solutions Claude Code + my domain knowledge = supervisor pattern we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have designed individually.\n3. Control over context \u0026gt; raw performance Having the option to manage conversation memory yourself is more valuable than slightly faster responses from a service that forces compaction.\n4. Privacy enables experimentation Knowing conversations stay local removes psychological barriers to trying wild ideas.\n5. Local doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean isolated Ollama + Claude Code = best of both worlds. Use local for persistent work, cloud for complex reasoning.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next Ollama was running. I had local control over my AI conversations. But the system was generating responses faster than I could organize them.\nWorking with Ollama over the next few days would generate hundreds more conversation files.

Half containerized, half bare metal. It worked, but it felt\u0026hellip; incomplete.\nThe question wasn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;Should I use K3s?\u0026rdquo; - K3s was already running. The question was: \u0026ldquo;Should I migrate everything to it?\u0026rdquo;\nThe Update Velocity Concern Before diving into migration, I had one critical concern: Would containerization slow down my ability to update software?\nWith native installs:\n# Ollama releases new version → 2 minutes later curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh sudo systemctl restart ollama # DONE. Latest version running. With Kubernetes Helm charts:\n# Ollama releases new version → wait for community maintainer # Community maintainer updates Helm chart → 9-39 days later helm repo update helm upgrade ollama ollama/ollama # NOW you\u0026amp;#39;re on the latest version. Weeks later. I needed to research this properly.\nSeptember 30, 12:00 PM: The Research Begins I created two research documents:\nK3s Full-Stack Containerization Research - Technical feasibility K3s Migration Value Score: Update Velocity Analysis - The hidden costs Key Finding #1: Community-Maintained Charts Lag Behind Ollama Example (Sept 30, 2025):\nOllama Official Release: - Latest: v0.12.3 (Sept 26, 2025) - Performance: 32-600% improvements over v0.11.x - Features: Web search API added Ollama Helm Chart (maintained by \u0026amp;#34;otwld\u0026amp;#34; - community volunteer): - Chart Version: ollama-1.29.0 (Sept 17, 2025) - App Version: v0.11.11 - Status: 10\u0026#43; versions behind official release - Maintainer: GitHub user, NOT Ollama Inc. Lag time: 9+ days (and counting).\nChromaDB Example:\nChromaDB Official Release: - Latest: v1.1.1 (Sept 24, 2025) - Previous: v1.1.0 (Sept 16, 2025) ChromaDB Helm Chart (maintained by \u0026amp;#34;amikos-tech\u0026amp;#34; - consulting company): - Chart Version: chromadb-0.1.24 (May 23, 2025) - Supported: 1.0.x or later - Status: No updates for 127 days Lag time: 127+ days.\nKey Finding #2: Vendor-Maintained Charts Have Zero Lag vLLM Production-Stack:\nvLLM Official Release: - Latest: Production-Stack (Jan 2025) - Maintainer: vLLM Project (vendor) - Helm Chart: Officially maintained by vLLM - Lag: ZERO days NVIDIA GPU Operator:\nNVIDIA Official Release: - Latest: v24.9.0 (Sept 2025) - Maintainer: NVIDIA Corporation - Helm Chart: Officially maintained - Lag: ZERO days - Bonus: Better than native apt installs (zero-downtime upgrades) The pattern was clear: When vendors maintain Helm charts, there\u0026rsquo;s no lag. When community volunteers maintain them, lag is 9-127+ days.\nThe Value Score Analysis I built a comprehensive scoring matrix weighing five categories:\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Value Score Analysis - September 30, 2025 │ └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Category Weight Native K3s Winner ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Update Velocity 35% 8.6 5.6 NATIVE (-3.0) Operational Mgmt 15% 5.8 9.8 K3S (\u0026#43;4.0) Scalability 10% 2.5 9.6 K3S (\u0026#43;7.1) Disaster Recovery 15% 4.3 8.8 K3S (\u0026#43;4.5) Learning Burden 25% 7.6 5.5 NATIVE (-2.1) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── WEIGHTED TOTAL 100% 6.68 7.09 K3S (\u0026#43;0.41) Result: K3s wins by 0.41 points\u0026hellip; but it\u0026rsquo;s dangerously close.\nThe Hidden Costs Update Velocity Tax: 9-39 days for critical AI services\nMissing 32-600% performance improvements while waiting for chart updates Depending on volunteer maintainers with no SLA Risk of chart abandonment (ChromaDB: no updates in 127 days) Complexity Tax: +30% operational overhead\nMust understand Kubernetes API, Helm, StatefulSets, PVCs, GPU operators Debugging through multiple abstraction layers Monitoring two sources: official releases AND Helm chart updates Dependency Tax: Your infrastructure depends on strangers\n\u0026ldquo;otwld\u0026rdquo; maintains Ollama chart - who is that? \u0026ldquo;amikos-tech\u0026rdquo; maintains ChromaDB chart - will they keep updating it? What if they abandon the project? September 30, 6:00 PM: The Hybrid Decision After 6 hours of research, I made the call: Selective containerization.\nKeep Native (update velocity critical):\n✅ Ollama (port 11434) Reason: Community Helm chart lags 9\u0026#43; days Impact: Miss performance improvements, new features ✅ ChromaDB (embedded \u0026#43; server) Reason: Community Helm chart lags 127\u0026#43; days Impact: Severe staleness, chart might be abandoned ✅ Aider (CLI tool) Reason: No K8s benefit, interactive workflow Move to K3s (vendor-maintained or operational benefit):\n✅ vLLM Reason: Vendor-maintained production-stack, zero lag Status: Pending migration ✅ NVIDIA GPU Operator Reason: Vendor-maintained, better than native apt Benefit: Zero-downtime driver upgrades, automatic compatibility ✅ FastMCP (port 8002) Reason: Operational benefits (monitoring, resource limits) Not update-critical ✅ Redis Reason: Bitnami vendor chart, StatefulSet benefits Already on K3s (no change needed):\n✅ LibreChat \u0026#43; MongoDB \u0026#43; RAG API ✅ Prometheus \u0026#43; Grafana ✅ Elasticsearch \u0026#43; Kibana ✅ Jaeger \u0026#43; OpenTelemetry Collector ✅ Kafka The final architecture: 70% native, 30% K3s - a deliberate hybrid.\nThe Rationale: Optimize for What Matters Why keep Ollama native?\nOllama is the inference engine. It\u0026rsquo;s the core of the AI workflow. Missing v0.12.x performance improvements (32-600% faster) for 9+ days while waiting for a community maintainer to update a Helm chart is unacceptable.\nWhy keep ChromaDB native?\n24,916 documents indexed. 127+ days without a Helm chart update suggests the maintainer has moved on. I can\u0026rsquo;t bet my knowledge base on abandoned infrastructure.\nWhy migrate vLLM to K3s?\nvLLM Project maintains their own production-stack Helm chart. Zero lag, first-class Kubernetes support, and it was released in January 2025 specifically for production workloads.\nWhy migrate NVIDIA drivers to GPU Operator?\nThis is the exception where K8s is better than native:\nAutomated driver lifecycle management Zero-downtime upgrades (no reboot required!) Automatic CUDA compatibility checks Rollback capability if upgrade fails GPU Operator provides features that don\u0026rsquo;t exist with apt install nvidia-driver-560.\nWhat Worked Research-Driven Decision: Two comprehensive research documents captured the tradeoffs. Not guessing - analyzing real-world data (Ollama v0.12.3 vs Helm chart v0.11.11).\nValue Score Matrix: Quantifying \u0026ldquo;Update Velocity\u0026rdquo; (35% weight) vs \u0026ldquo;Disaster Recovery\u0026rdquo; (15% weight) made the hybrid approach obvious.\nAcknowledging Community Maintainers: \u0026ldquo;otwld\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;amikos-tech\u0026rdquo; are doing unpaid work to maintain Helm charts. The lag isn\u0026rsquo;t their fault - it\u0026rsquo;s the nature of volunteer efforts. Recognizing this helps set realistic expectations.\nGPU Operator Discovery: Finding the ONE case where K8s is genuinely better than native (NVIDIA driver management) validated that selective containerization makes sense.\nWhat Still Sucked Fragmented Architecture: Half on K3s, half native. Two mental models. Two sets of tools (kubectl vs systemctl). Two monitoring approaches.\nMaintenance Burden: Now I have to track:\nOfficial Ollama releases (for native install) Official vLLM releases (for K3s) Helm chart updates (for containerized services) GPU Operator compatibility (for driver management) The \u0026ldquo;Incomplete\u0026rdquo; Feeling: It\u0026rsquo;s not elegant. It\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;all-in\u0026rdquo; on Kubernetes. But it\u0026rsquo;s pragmatic.\nThe Numbers (September 30, 2025) Metric Value Research Time 6 hours Research Documents Created 2 (47 pages combined) Services on K3s 10 Services Staying Native 3 (Ollama, ChromaDB, Aider) Services Migrating to K3s 3 (vLLM, NVIDIA drivers, FastMCP) Helm Chart Update Lag (Ollama) 9+ days Helm Chart Update Lag (ChromaDB) 127+ days Value Score (Hybrid) 7.8/10 Value Score (Full K3s) 7.1/10 Value Score (All Native) 5.9/10 ★ Insight ───────────────────────────────────── The Hidden Cost of Abstraction:\nContainerization sounds like a pure win: isolation, portability, orchestration. But there\u0026rsquo;s a cost most tutorials don\u0026rsquo;t mention:\nWhen you containerize vendor software using community-maintained Helm charts, you introduce a third party into your update pipeline:\nVendor Release → Community Maintainer → Your Deployment (Day 0) (Day 9-127) (When you notice) Native installs bypass the middle layer:\nVendor Release → Your Deployment (Day 0) (Day 0) The question isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;Is Kubernetes better?\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Is the orchestration benefit worth the update lag for THIS service?\u0026rdquo;\nFor Ollama (core AI inference): No. For vLLM (vendor-maintained chart): Yes. For Prometheus (already containerized): Yes.\nBlanket decisions fail. Selective decisions win. ─────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhat I Learned 1. \u0026ldquo;Modern infrastructure\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean \u0026ldquo;containerize everything\u0026rdquo; The best architecture uses the right tool for each component. Sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s K8s. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s systemctl.\n2. Community-maintained Helm charts are gifts, not guarantees \u0026ldquo;otwld\u0026rdquo; maintaining Ollama\u0026rsquo;s Helm chart is generous volunteer work. But depending on it for production means accepting 9+ day update lag.\n3. Vendor-maintained charts change the equation vLLM and NVIDIA maintaining official Helm charts meant zero lag. If Ollama Inc. released an official chart tomorrow, I\u0026rsquo;d migrate immediately.\n4. Research prevents regret 6 hours of research on September 30 prevented weeks of frustration from migrating Ollama to K3s, then waiting 9+ days for critical updates.\n5. Hybrid architectures are valid (even if messy) 70% native, 30% K3s isn\u0026rsquo;t elegant. But it optimizes for update velocity (critical) while gaining orchestration benefits (nice-to-have).\nBuilt on Open Source This research episode relied on incredible open source projects and communities:\nK3s by Rancher Labs - Lightweight Kubernetes that made single-node clusters practical for homelabs.\nOllama Helm Chart maintained by otwld - Community-maintained chart that, despite lag concerns, made Ollama deployment on K8s possible for thousands of users.\nChromaDB Helm Chart by amikos-tech - Open source effort to bring vector database orchestration to Kubernetes.\nvLLM Production-Stack - Vendor-maintained Kubernetes deployment showing how official support eliminates update lag.\nNVIDIA GPU Operator - Enterprise-grade GPU management that proved containerization can be BETTER than native.\nMassive thanks to all maintainers - vendor-backed and community volunteers alike. Your work makes modern AI infrastructure possible.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next September 30 ended with a decision: Hybrid architecture.\nImmediate plans:\nKeep Ollama native (avoid 9+ day lag) Keep ChromaDB native (avoid 127+ day lag) Migrate vLLM to K3s (vendor chart, zero lag) Deploy NVIDIA GPU Operator (better than native) Unknown at the time: By October 5, none of this would matter.\nBy October 5, 9:00 AM, K3s would have 6,812 pod restarts. By October 5, 10:00 AM, I\u0026rsquo;d discover the networking layer was completely broken. By October 5, 6:00 PM, I\u0026rsquo;d have rebuilt the entire cluster from scratch.\nThe hybrid architecture decision was sound. But the infrastructure beneath it was about to fail spectacularly.\nNext Episode: \u0026ldquo;When Everything Crashes: The K3s Resurrection\u0026rdquo; - 6,812 pod restarts, a broken CNI plugin, and the day that tested every decision from Episode 5.\nThis is Episode 5 of \u0026ldquo;Season 1: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure\u0026rdquo; - documenting the research that revealed containerization\u0026rsquo;s hidden costs.\nPrevious Episode: ChromaDB Weekend: From 504 to 24,916 Documents Complete Series: Season 1 Mapping Report\n","permalink":"https://blog.rduffy.uk/posts/season-1-episode-5-migration-question/","summary":"K3s was already running.

But pods were dying.\nCheck #2: Pod Logs (Claude suggested checking this first)\nkubectl logs convocanvas-7d4b9c8f6-xk2p9 -n convocanvas Output:\nError: Failed to connect to ollama.ollama.svc.cluster.local:11434 Connection refused Check #3: DNS Resolution (Claude\u0026rsquo;s debugging pattern)\nkubectl run -it --rm debug --image=busybox --restart=Never -- nslookup ollama.ollama.svc.cluster.local Output:\nServer: 10.43.0.10 Address: 10.43.0.10:53 ** server can\u0026amp;#39;t find ollama.ollama.svc.cluster.local: NXDOMAIN DNS was broken.\nServices couldn\u0026rsquo;t resolve each other. The entire cluster networking was down.\n8:30 AM: Deeper Investigation Check CoreDNS (Claude suggested checking the DNS pod):\nkubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep coredns Output:\ncoredns-7b8c7b8d4-x9k2p 0/1 CrashLoopBackOff 892 3d CoreDNS was crashing too.\nCheck CoreDNS Logs:\nkubectl logs coredns-7b8c7b8d4-x9k2p -n kube-system Output:\n[FATAL] plugin/loop: Loop (127.0.0.1:53 -\u0026amp;gt; :53) detected for zone \u0026amp;#34;.\u0026amp;#34;, see https://coredns.io/plugins/loop#troubleshooting.

When the host IP changes, Flannel\u0026rsquo;s cached network configuration becomes invalid, causing the DNS loop.\u0026rdquo;\n9:00 AM: The Fix (Collaborative Debugging) Vault Evidence: The fix file shows three solution options with Claude\u0026rsquo;s analysis of pros/cons for each.\nClaude and I discussed three solutions:\nOption 1: Clean Restart (Recommended by Claude)\nsudo systemctl stop k3s sudo rm -f /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/cred/node-passwd sudo systemctl start k3s Option 2: Pin to Specific IP (Claude\u0026rsquo;s alternative)\nsudo vi /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service # Add: --node-ip=192.168.1.180 sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl restart k3s Option 3: Pin to Interface (Claude\u0026rsquo;s best long-term solution)\nsudo vi /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service # Add: --flannel-iface=wlp5s0 sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl restart k3s We went with Option 1 for immediate recovery, then implemented Option 3 for long-term stability.\n9:15 AM: The Recovery # Stop K3s sudo systemctl stop k3s # Remove cached network credentials sudo rm -f /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/cred/node-passwd # Start K3s (will re-detect network) sudo systemctl start k3s # Wait 60 seconds sleep 60 # Verify kubectl get nodes kubectl get pods -A Result:\nNAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION leveling-pc Ready control-plane,master 3d v1.30.5\u0026#43;k3s1 Node: Ready ✅\nPods starting:\nNAMESPACE NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE convocanvas convocanvas-7d4b9c8f6-xk2p9 1/1 Running 0 15s chromadb chromadb-0 1/1 Running 0 18s monitoring prometheus-server-0 1/1 Running 0 12s ... ALL PODS HEALTHY ✅\nThe cluster was back.\n10:00 AM: Implementing the Permanent Fix Working with Claude, I implemented Option 3 to prevent this from happening again:\n# Edit K3s service sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/k3s.service # Added this flag to ExecStart line: --flannel-iface=wlp5s0 \\ # Reload and restart sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl restart k3s # Verify everything still works kubectl get nodes kubectl get pods -A Result: K3s now pinned to the WiFi interface. Future IP changes won\u0026rsquo;t break the cluster.\nWhat Worked Systematic Debugging (Claude\u0026rsquo;s approach):\nCheck node status Check pod logs Check DNS resolution Check CoreDNS status Check network configuration Identify root cause Implement fix Collaboration with Claude: The debugging pattern, solution options analysis, and long-term fix recommendations came from working together. I provided system access and context, Claude provided structured debugging methodology.\nClean Recovery: Option 1 (clean restart) got the cluster running in minutes.\nPermanent Fix: Option 3 (interface pinning) prevents recurrence.\nWhat Still Sucked Silent Failure: 6,812 restarts over days/weeks with no alerting. I had no idea the cluster was broken.\nNo Monitoring: Should have had alerts on pod restart counts \u0026gt;10.\nDHCP Dependency: Infrastructure relying on DHCP is fragile. Static IPs would prevent this.\nLost Time: Unknown how long the cluster was actually down. Could have been days of lost service.\nThe Numbers (October 5, 2025) Metric Value Discovery Time 08:23 AM (Saturday) Total Restarts 6,812 Diagnosis Time 22 minutes (08:23-08:45) Recovery Time 30 minutes (09:00-09:30) Permanent Fix 30 minutes (10:00-10:30) Total Downtime Unknown (days/weeks) Detection to Recovery ~1 hour Services Affected All K3s workloads (LibreChat, RAG, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Jaeger, Kafka) Services Unaffected Host services (Ollama, FastMCP, GPU Monitor) ★ Insight ───────────────────────────────────── Infrastructure Resilience Lessons:\nThis K3s crash taught critical lessons about production infrastructure:\nAlerting is Non-Negotiable: 6,812 restarts should have triggered alerts at restart #10. Silent failures are the worst kind.\nNetwork Dependencies Kill Clusters: Depending on DHCP for infrastructure IPs introduces fragility. Static IPs or interface pinning prevents this.\nSystematic Debugging Saves Time: Working with Claude\u0026rsquo;s structured approach (node→pods→logs→DNS→network) found the root cause in 22 minutes.\nCollaboration Accelerates Recovery: Human access + AI patterns = faster diagnosis than either alone.\nPermanent Fixes \u0026gt; Quick Fixes: Option 1 got us running, but Option 3 prevented future failures. Both matter.\nThe real problem wasn\u0026rsquo;t the crash - it was not knowing it had crashed until manual inspection. ─────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWhat I Learned 1. Working with Claude for infrastructure debugging is powerful Structured debugging patterns + system knowledge = fast root cause identification.\n2. Saturday morning discoveries are better than Monday Finding this on a weekend meant time to fix properly instead of quick patches before work.\n3. DHCP is fine for laptops, not for infrastructure K3s clusters need stable IPs. Either static assignment or interface pinning.\n4. Monitoring gaps are invisible until failure Everything seemed fine\u0026hellip; until I manually checked. Alerts would have caught this days earlier.\n5. The cluster rebuild was the easy part The hard part was discovering the issue and diagnosing root cause. Recovery took 30 minutes; diagnosis took longer.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next October 5, 10:30 AM. K3s was back. All pods healthy. The cluster was resilient again.\nBut the system still couldn\u0026rsquo;t document itself.\nWith 23 pods running, multiple services deployed, and complex networking, I needed automated architecture diagrams that updated themselves.\nBy October 7, working with Claude, I\u0026rsquo;d build exactly that.\nNext Episode: \u0026ldquo;Teaching the System to Document Itself\u0026rdquo; - Automated architecture diagrams that generate from cluster state.\nThis is Episode 6 of \u0026ldquo;Season 1: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure\u0026rdquo; - documenting the Saturday morning crash that tested everything.\nPrevious Episode: The Migration Question Next Episode: Teaching the System to Document Itself Complete Series: Season 1 Mapping Report\n","permalink":"https://blog.rduffy.uk/posts/season-1-episode-6-k3s-crash-resurrection/","summary":"Saturday morning, October 5, 2025.
