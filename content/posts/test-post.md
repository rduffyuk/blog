## This Is A Test Post

If you're reading this, it means my automated blog publishing system is working!

### What Just Happened?

1. I wrote this post in **Obsidian** (my knowledge management tool)
2. Moved it to the `published/` folder
3. Ran the staging script
4. Reviewed the preview locally
5. Approved and published
6. **It's now live on Cloudflare Pages!**

### The Tech Stack

- **Writing**: Obsidian vault
- **Static Site Generator**: Hugo with PaperMod theme
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages (free!)
- **Automation**: Python script + Git
- **Deployment**: Automatic on git push

### Why This Is Cool

This workflow means I can:
- Write in the tool I use daily (Obsidian)
- Review before publishing (no accidents!)
- Version control everything (it's all git)
- Deploy globally in seconds (Cloudflare CDN)
- Cost: **£0/month**

More technical deep-dives coming soon!
