ðŸš€ Season 1 Complete: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure

8 episodes documenting 25 days building AI infrastructure with Claude Code as a partner.

ðŸ’¡ Key learning: AI as a collaborator (not replacement) enabled me to build systems I couldn't build alone.

ðŸš€ Season 1 Complete: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure

I just finished documenting 25 days of building AI infrastructure through human + AI collaboration.

**The Journey (Sept 11 - Oct 5, 2025):**
â†’ Day Zero: Context window problem sparks ConvoCanvas vision
â†’ Week 1: FastAPI MVP in 3 days (working with Claude Code)
â†’ Week 2: Ollama + 17 local models on RTX 4080
â†’ Week 3: ChromaDB semantic search (504 â†’ 24,916 documents)
â†’ Week 4: K3s crash recovery (6,812 pod restarts)
â†’ Final: Automated diagrams + this blog series

**The Reality:**
Built around full-time job at BT. Weekend sessions, evening debugging, honest failures documented.

**The Lesson:**
I'm a simple engineer who's not great at coding. But AI as a tool - used right - enabled me to transition my self-development to new bounds.

Not because AI "did it for me." Because:
â€¢ Claude provided patterns I didn't know existed
â€¢ I provided context and judgment AI couldn't have
â€¢ Together we debugged problems neither could solve alone

**This is the exciting future:** What we can achieve together with AI when we use it as a collaborator.

## Long Version (Full Post)

ðŸš€ Season 1 Complete: From Zero to Automated Infrastructure

After 25 days and 8 episodes, I've documented the complete journey of building AI infrastructure through human + AI collaboration. Here's the story:

**Episode 1: Day Zero (Sept 11)**
"Maximum context length exceeded." That error changed everything. Working with Claude Code, I designed ConvoCanvas - a system to parse AI conversations and generate content.

**Episode 2: MVP (Sept 14-15)**
Vault creation, LibreChat deployment, FastAPI backend. Three days from idea to working code. Not because I'm brilliant - because Claude + me = better than either alone.

**Episode 3: The AI Awakening (Sept 18-19)**
Context limits still plaguing me. Solution: Ollama + 17 local models on RTX 4080. Weekend installation working with Claude to optimize VRAM, design supervisor patterns, achieve 71.6 tokens/sec with DeepSeek R1.

**Episode 4: Documentation Overload (Sept 20-27)**
1,142 markdown files in 11 days. Manual search: 25 minutes. ChromaDB semantic search: 0.4 seconds. Weekend implementation, Monday demo at work, Friday scaling to 24,916 documents. The blurry line between personal projects and work tools.

**Episode 5: The Infrastructure Debate (Sept 30)**
Kubernetes for a single-machine personal project? Overkill? Maybe. But learning opportunity? Absolutely. K3s research day, 47 documentation files, choosing growth over simplicity.

**Episode 6: When Everything Crashes (Oct 5)**
Saturday morning. 23 pods expected. 6,812 pod restarts discovered. DHCP IP changed, DNS broke, K3s died silently for days. Working with Claude: systematic debugging, 1-hour recovery. The lesson: silent failures are the worst kind.

**Episode 7: Teaching the System to Document Itself (Oct 7)**
Can't visualize 23 pods across 7 namespaces anymore. Solution: Automated ASCII diagrams generated from live cluster state. Daily Prefect job queries K3s â†’ generates diagrams â†’ commits to git. The system documents its own architecture.

**Episode 8: Teaching AI to Blog About Itself (Oct 5-6)**
"Search the vault and create a blog series." Working with Claude, we analyzed 1,142 files, 200+ conversations, 25 days of development. Not automated blog generation - collaborative documentation. Human context + AI pattern recognition + vault evidence = this series.

**The Honest Reality:**

This wasn't a clean startup sprint. This was:
â€¢ Full-time job at BT (Monday-Friday)
â€¢ Weekend coding sessions
â€¢ Evening debugging
â€¢ Work demos of personal projects
â€¢ 3-day gaps between planning and implementation
â€¢ Honest failures documented

ConvoCanvas isn't "complete." It's on pause while I rethink everything. Because AI capabilities change weekly - what I built in September might be obsolete by November.

**What I Learned:**

Before AI assistance, architectures like this were beyond my skill level. I'd have gotten stuck on Kubernetes networking, never figured out ChromaDB integration, struggled with async Python patterns.

But AI as a tool - used right - enabled me to transition my self-development to new bounds.

Not because AI "did it for me." Because:
â€¢ Claude provided patterns I didn't know existed
â€¢ I provided context and judgment AI couldn't have
â€¢ Together we debugged problems neither could solve alone
â€¢ I learned constantly by seeing how Claude approached problems

**This is the exciting time ahead for us all.**

What we can achieve together with AI - when we use it as a collaborator, not a replacement - is genuinely transformative.

A year ago, this infrastructure would have taken me months and probably failed. With Claude Code as a partner, 25 days produced a working system I actually understand.

**Read the complete series:** https://blog.rduffy.uk/tags/season-1/

**Topics covered:**
â€¢ FastAPI backend development
â€¢ Ollama local LLM deployment (17 models)
â€¢ ChromaDB semantic search (24,916 documents)
â€¢ K3s lightweight Kubernetes
â€¢ Automated architecture diagrams
â€¢ Human + AI collaborative development
â€¢ Building while working full-time

**Tech stack:**
â€¢ Languages: Python, Bash, YAML
â€¢ AI: Ollama, Claude Code, LibreChat, DeepSeek R1
â€¢ Infrastructure: K3s, Docker, Prefect
â€¢ Data: ChromaDB, vector embeddings, semantic search
â€¢ Tools: Obsidian vault, MCP, FastAPI

**What comes next?**

No grand promises. Just honest possibilities:
â€¢ Further refinement of the core system
â€¢ Integration of new AI capabilities as they emerge
â€¢ Continued learning through human + AI collaboration
â€¢ More honest documentation of what works and what doesn't
â€¢ Building in public, failing in public, learning in public

Not a conclusion. A checkpoint. The journey continues, one day at a time, with AI as a partner.
